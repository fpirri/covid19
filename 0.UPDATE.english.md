The data comes from the [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) website, which collects data from almost all over the world, separately for each country.
The graphs presented below collect data from several countries, purified with a weighted average over seven days to eliminate the weekly periodicity that many countries have in collecting data.
Weights attach more importance to the most recent data.

All the graphs show Spain and Germany, since Spain almost always presents the maximum of deaths while Germany almost always presents the minimum.  
The first group also contains Italy, France and the United Kingdom.  
The second group also contains Sweden and the United States of America.

Germany's advantage over everyone else is growing again this week.  
There is the relegation of the United Kingdom with respect to Italy, for the failure to exit the crisis of the United Kingdom.

Ranking June 4, 2020:
*    Germany   60
*    USA      35
*    Sweden   24
*    France    22
*    Italy     14
*    UK      11
*    Spain     10
<br />
  
NOTES:  
* The UK added deaths, reported late  
    * for this reason, the expected end of the crisis period has not occurred
    * the total number of deaths per million inhabitants exceeded that of Italy
* the United States continues to move closer to exiting the crisis
    * the total number of deaths per million inhabitants remains intermediate between the European average and Germany
* Sweden continues to decline, but very slowly
    * the total number of deaths is close to that of France
* the correction of the data by Spain continues
    * daily deaths remain limited to a few deaths per day
    * is it safe to think that this happens because the tourist season is approaching?

The ranking continues the downward crushing, that is, Germany's advantage over all the others grows.

Ranking May 28, 2020:
*    Germany   60
*    USA      39
*    Sweden   28
*    France    22
*    UK      16
*    Italy     15
*    Spain     10
<br />
  
NOTES:  
* The United Kingdom is approaching the end of the crisis period
     * at the end of next week?  
* The United States seems more distant  
     * end of the period in the second week of June?
* Sweden does not improve the trend of deaths  
     * the weekly variability of the data complicates the forecasts
     * in the next few days it will be possible to understand if a second wave of deaths is approaching
* Spain corrects the trend of deaths:  
   * May 25 Spain removes 1915 deaths from the total (did they come back to life?)  
   * in the following days it reports only one death per day  
   * I consider these data totally unreliable

    * France made a small downward correction
    * Spain has made both downward and upward corrections in the last period, as can be seen from the graphs
* according to many unconfirmed rumors, all upward corrections are less than what would be necessary

Personal remark
----

I started writing my observations to focus on the data and better understand what was going on.  
From the start, the way they presented the epidemic on TV and in the newspapers disturbed me.  
There was a continuous reference to the so-called ***most affected country***, always identified on the basis of the total number of deaths, without ever reporting the figure in relation to the population.  
As if it were fair to directly compare the total number of road accidents in a country village with the total accidents in a metropolis.  
    
It was only later that I realized that many people, believed to be of high culture, had difficulty understanding the difference between the percentage of deaths in the population and the total number of deaths.  
To be fair, if you pointed it out, someone understood it and reflected on it, but in almost all of them the initial statement of the journalists remained acceptable and correct.  
  
I then introduced the ranking list, thus hoping to use more understandable language.  
  
In retrospect I am sorry to say that the success has been modest (or worse).

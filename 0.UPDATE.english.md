The data comes from the  [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) website, which collects the numbers we see on TV and in newspapers from all over the world.  
The graphs are made with an average weighed over seven days to eliminate periodicity in the collection of data in many countries.
Weights attach more importance to the most recent data.
All the graphs show Spain and Germany, which contain the data of all the others.  
The first group also contains Italy, France and the United Kingdom.
The second group also contains Sweden and the United States of America.

The ranking continues the downward crushing, that is, Germany's advantage over all the others grows.

Ranking May 28, 2020:
*    Germany   60
*    USA      39
*    Sweden   28
*    France    22
*    UK      16
*    Italy     15
*    Spain     10
<br />
  
NOTES:  
* The United Kingdom is approaching the end of the crisis period
     * at the end of next week?  
* The United States seems more distant  
     * end of the period in the second week of June?
* Sweden does not improve the trend of deaths  
     * the weekly variability of the data complicates the forecasts
     * in the next few days it will be possible to understand if a second wave of deaths is approaching
* Spain corrects the trend of deaths:  
     * May 25 removes 1915 deaths from the total (did they come back to life?)
      * in the following days it reports only one death per day
       * I consider these data totally unreliable

<br />
  
NOTES:
* Spain exits the critical period on May 15th
* Italy and France come out on May 21st
* Germany was the first to exit on May 10 and, since then, has gained scores compared to other countries
    * in essence the ranking is pushed down for all other countries
* over time there have been corrections of the data on the site:
    * UK and USA added deaths in one or more periods
    * France made a small downward correction
    * Spain has made both downward and upward corrections in the last period, as can be seen from the graphs
* according to many unconfirmed rumors, all upward corrections are less than what would be necessary

Personal remark
----

I started writing my observations to focus on the data and better understand what was going on.  
From the start, the way they presented the epidemic on TV and in the newspapers disturbed me.  
There was a continuous reference to the so-called *** most affected country ***, always identified on the basis of the total number of deaths, without ever reporting the figure in relation to the population.  
As if it were fair to directly compare the total number of road accidents in a country village with the total accidents in a metropolis.  
    
It was only later that I realized that many people, believed to be of high culture, had difficulty understanding the difference between the percentage of deaths in the population and the total number of deaths.  
To be fair, if you pointed it out, someone understood it and reflected on it, but in almost all of them the initial statement of the journalists remained acceptable and correct.  
  
I then introduced the ranking list, thus hoping to use more understandable language.  
  
In retrospect I am sorry to say that the success has been modest (or worse).

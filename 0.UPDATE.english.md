The data comes from the [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) website, which collects data from almost all over the world, separately for each country.
The graphs presented below collect data from several countries, purified with a weighted average over seven days to eliminate the weekly periodicity that many countries have in collecting data.
Weights attach more importance to the most recent data.

To better appreciate the differences, the group of Central Europe countries is reported separately, which have a very similar evolution:

It is noted that Spain had the highest deaths at the beginning, to be eventually overtaken by the United Kingdom.
Germany always has the minimum. The ratio of other countries' deaths to Germany ranges from 3.4 in the US to 5.9 in the UK.  

The following graph shows how Sweden initially develops similar to the United States of America, but subsequently grows much more and then remains at higher levels, until it falls within the average of the other European countries:

Germany's advantage over everyone else is growing again this week.

The ranking continues the downward crushing, that is, Germany's advantage over all the others grows.

Ranking May 28, 2020:

     * at the end of next week?  
* The United States seems more distant  
     * end of the period in the second week of June?
* Sweden does not improve the trend of deaths  
     * the weekly variability of the data complicates the forecasts
     * in the next few days it will be possible to understand if a second wave of deaths is approaching
* Spain corrects the trend of deaths:  
   * May 25 Spain removes 1915 deaths from the total (did they come back to life?)  
   * in the following days it reports only one death per day  
   * I consider these data totally unreliable

Personal remark
----

I started writing my observations to focus on the data and better understand what was going on.  
From the start, the way they presented the epidemic on TV and in the newspapers disturbed me.  
There was a continuous reference to the so-called ***most affected country***, always identified on the basis of the total number of deaths, without ever reporting the figure in relation to the population.  
As if it were fair to directly compare the total number of road accidents in a country village with the total accidents in a metropolis.  
    
It was only later that I realized that many people, believed to be of high culture, had difficulty understanding the difference between the percentage of deaths in the population and the total number of deaths.  
To be fair, if you pointed it out, someone understood it and reflected on it, but in almost all of them the initial statement of the journalists remained acceptable and correct.  
  
I then introduced the ranking list, thus hoping to use more understandable language.  
  
In retrospect I am sorry to say that the success has been modest (or worse).

Mats Lewan raised a very interesting question, which I rewrite in this way: are the measures taken by the various governments effective?
The choice to consider deaths as an essential element for a first assessment of the COVID19 crisis is a good choice: good Mats!

The crisis consists in a phase of exponential expansion of the infected people and dead, up to a maximum which will be followed by a phase of decrease, which may reach zero or settle on endemic values.
I consider it essential to evaluate the extent of the crisis with a formal and objective method.
I propose to consider as an efficacy parameter the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the infection until reaching the maximum number of deaths in a day, before the decrease in the number of daily deaths.
Since this is a statistical phenomenon, the numbers must be large enough. I therefore propose the following criteria:
- the day on which the total deaths in a country exceeds the threshold of 5 deaths per million inhabitants is taken as the day of the start of the crisis;
- the end of the period will be taken on the day when the average for the following week is lower than the average for the week preceding the day in question.
At the present time the day of the maximum in the western world is unknown.
I propose to include in the evaluation also the dates of the 'lockdown' measures issued by the governments, to have a second measuring point (date M1).
These choices are an attempt to standardize the evaluation period with respect to the differences between the various nations.
The number of days between the various events will allow to evaluate the effectiveness of the lockdown, where this was done.

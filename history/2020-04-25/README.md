It is really very difficult to understand what is happening in our world because of the coronavirus! 
This is an attempt to dispel the fog caused by the numbers that are thrown to us many times a day by the various news programs. The idea was born from a discussion on the following forum: https://e-catworld.com/2020/03/27/covid-19-thread-3-26-2020-mats-lewan-on-the-case-of-sweden/
  
Mats Lewan looked at the number of deaths in any given day in several countries and shared is thoughts in the blog.  
So I looked for data on the website https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries which presents a lot of data on almost all the nations of the world.  
The site places a lot of emphasis on the number of sick and healed, but also on the total deaths in each individual country.  
TV follows the same format and assigns the 'primacy' to the country with the highest number of deaths. Now it's up to the USA.  
The total number of deaths seems very important, so I took the data from the site and presented it on a single graph to better appreciate the differences.  
The graph collects the following countries: Italy, Spain, France, Sweden, UK, USA and Germany.

Looking at the graph, the primacy is immediately assigned to the USA, which dominate all the other countries.  
But is that right?  
It does not seem correct to me to directly compare what happens in a country of 331 million inhabitants with what happens in a country of 10 million inhabitants like Sweden.  
Following Mats's thoughts, I then reported the number of deaths per million inhabitants on the graph.

This document is very disorganized: I am trying to coordinate my thoughts, but I cannot find a common thread in the many things I read online.
I need help. Do you have any suggestion?

I choose to look at the number  of Deaths caused by Covid19 in many countries is

How do countries fight with coronavirus?

Let's have a look at total deaths in a few western coountries:

It is really very difficult to understand what is happening in our world because of the coronavirus! This is an attempt to dispel the fog caused by the numbers that are thrown to us many times a day by the various news programs. The idea was born from a discussion on the following forum: https://e-catworld.com/2020/03/27/covid-19-thread-3-26-2020-mats-lewan-on-the-case-of-sweden/

Mats Lewan raised a very interesting question, which I rewrite in this way: are the measures taken by the various governments effective? The choice to consider deaths as an essential element for a first assessment of the COVID19 crisis is a good choice: good Mats!

The crisis consists in a phase of exponential expansion of the infected people and dead, up to a maximum which will be followed by a phase of decrease, which may reach zero or settle on endemic values. I consider it essential to evaluate the extent of the crisis with a formal and objective method. I propose to consider as an efficacy parameter the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the infection until reaching the maximum number of deaths in a day, before the decrease in the number of daily deaths. Since this is a statistical phenomenon, the numbers must be large enough. I therefore propose the following criteria:

    the day on which the total deaths in a country exceeds the threshold of 5 deaths per million inhabitants is taken as the day of the start of the crisis;
    the end of the period will be taken on the day when the average for the following week is lower than the average for the week preceding the day in question.

At the present time the day of the maximum in the western world is unknown.

I propose to include in the evaluation also the dates of the 'lockdown' measures issued by the governments, to have a second measuring point (date M1).

These choices are an attempt to standardize the evaluation period with respect to the differences between the various nations. The number of days between the various events will allow to evaluate the effectiveness of the lockdown, where this was done.

Please have a look at the attached spreadsheet.
